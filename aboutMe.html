                   <p>I was born in Flint Michigan on August 26th, 1995. I only lived in Flint for a few years before my parents and I moved north to East Jordan Michigan. I live here for a few years, where I spent most my time outside. I lived in the middle of the woods, with a lot of land. Here I learned a lot of life lessons like not to play with fire and how life only lasts so long. I also got my first baby sister while living in this house. Her name is Brandy and she also taught me a lot of life lessons. Around the end of kindergarten, my grandma lost the house we were renting from her, leaving us without a home. We ended up in Whiting Park for an entire summer. A few weeks before I was supposed to start first grade, my parents found a house in Boyne City. This is where I grew up for most of my life. In 2002, I got another sister named Anna adding to our family some more. Then in 2009 I gained another sibling, except this one was a brother.
                   <br><br>
                   The big moments of my life was when I found music. Around 2nd grade, we had a person come in and talk to us about learning a string instrument. Thanks to that person, I became interested in playing music. I learned the viola for two years, then the recorder in fourth grade, then clarinet/bass clarinet from sixth through twelfth grade. Music became such a big part of my life in middle school when I joined band and learned the clarinet. It’s where I actually made friends and started to enjoy school. Seventh grade is when I meet my best friend of almost ten years now. His name is Chris Moore and he had transferred to our school that year.
                   <br><br>
                   When high school hit, I started to be a lot more social than I had been before. I became apart of what we, and the whole school called the “Nerd Herd”. Truly, you could say that the herd really just moved up to the next level. The nerd herd, was like the popular kids combined with the nerds. Everyone knew us, asked us for help with school, and everyone respected us. We were the top of the food chain as we advanced through high school. We were all apart of everything in our high school. If there was a club or organization that one of us wasn’t in, it was because it was football or the cheer team. We invaded everything else in our school. I was on the tennis team, First Robotics, Band, and our Visual Imaging team. These activities are what made me grow as a person, and lead me to wanting to be a programmer. I choose to go to Michigan Technological University for my college education in Software Engineering.

                    <p>I started my first semester at Michigan Tech in the fall of 2014 as a Computer Science Student. One of the neat things Michigan Tech does is a week long orientation. I really enjoyed this week looking back on it. It gave me plenty of time to get used to the campus, it also introduced me to other first years in my major, and taught me about how the campus works. The most entertaining and embarrassing part of that first week was due to how my orientation leader handled things. Due to our nature as computer scientists, we don’t usually talk or open up right away, and to fight this our leader would make us dance every day. We even introduced ourselves to our group through dance moves. It was a crazy way to handle anti-social people, but it really got some of us out of our shells. The worst of it, was when we had to do the wobble with a group of girls. Half of us didn’t participate, while the rest embarrassed ourselves in the middle of campus. It was a crazy way to start our first year but it was a fun time.
                    <br><br>
                    With my love of music, I had found the infamous Huskies Pep Band with their saying “The Cream of the Keweenaw, The Pride of Pasty Land, The Second-Best Feeling in the World, The Huskies Pep Band”. I joined the Concussion (percussion) section as a bass drum player and got really involved really fast. In order to play at anything that the band plays at, I needed one thing, a crazy hat. Through needing this, I found the fraternity Mu Beta Psi. They held a rush for the pep band, where you can use their supplies to make a crazy hat, or bring your own and be around people while making it. I made a hat out of gatorade bottles, which was pretty crazy in my mind. I also made quite a few friends at this rush, leading me to hang with the unique co-ed fraternity that is Mu Beta Psi.
                    <br><br>
                    Later in the year, I ended up pledging into Mu Beta Psi and gained a new family while at college. This group was so different and unique, that it felt slightly different than my nerd herd from high school. It was a good different, which is why I choose to join, even though I came to college saying that I’d never become apart of greek life. My next 3 years were hell, like every students life at Michigan Tech. I choose to become heavily involved in Mu Beta Psi, and took on many important roles such as President, Webmaster, and Our Member At Large. I even planned and hosted one of our national conventions here on Michigan Tech’s campus. These experiences are extremely important to me because it’s what helped me learn and develop as a leader.
                    <br><br>
                    On a more experience level, I’ve gotten two internships while at Michigan Tech. My first one was during the summer after my Junior year at Jackson National Life insurance. They had a office in Houghton that was purely interns and one boss, and I got to be apart of that. My experience there was not what I thought I’d get because I didn’t really get much experience. I had one project that I got to work on and finish, and it took almost a month to be able to start working on it. The project was neat, in the idea that I got to use a language I hadn’t used before, which was ColdFusion, but it was the only thing I really did. The rest of the summer was me sitting around waiting on permissions from IT and doing nothing. I can’t say it wasn’t nice, because I was getting paid to sit in the office and do nothing most of the time, but it’s not quite what I wanted out of an internship.
                    <br><br>
                    My second internship, which is my current internship is at Superior Technologies. The boss of the office for Jackson, ended up making a new company after they closed down the office. Superior Technologies is a software firm that specializes in BlockChain and Cryptocurrency. They took over the office that Jackson left, allowing me to have my second summer here in Houghton Michigan.

                Currently, I have one more semester at Michigan Tech, and will be graduating in December. I am currently working at Superior Technologies in Houghton Mi, enjoying the summer as much as I can.
