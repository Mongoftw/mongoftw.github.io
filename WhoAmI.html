	<div class="List-of-stuff">
	<h3> The Nerd Herd </h3>

	This group is a group I can't say enough about. This group is the Nerd Herd. I've been with these amazing people since about my 8th grade year. They have 
	been my family for five years and without them I probably wouldn't be the person I am today. Always there willing to help me 
	and always there to hang out and have fun. If I had a class with any of them, I knew I was going to have fun while learning. Each 
	one of these people are special to me and without them I would feel empty. Each is smart in their own way and each of them 
	are nerdy in their own way as well. Splitting the Herd when going to college was hard, but I believe it was best for each 
	of our futures. I can't say enough about them, but I need to stop. This group is the group I am most proud of being apart of.

	<div class="Psi-info"> 
	<p> 
	I joined Mu Beta Psi, the Music and service fraternity here on Michigan Tech's campus during my first semester first year. 
	I have to say, starting college I was anti-fraternity and never planned on joining one. 
	Then I meet Psi and knew it was my home away from home. Psi is a place I learned to be myself here at college and 
	without them I don't know who I would be now. Mu Beta Psi is a Co-Ed Fraternity that helps advance music within the 
	college community as well as everywhere else. If you would like to know more about Psi you can go to their National 
	website by clicking <a href="http://www.mubetapsi.org/"> <strong>Here</strong> </a>.

	FRC stands for First Robotics Competition which is put on by FIRST. This program is for students from when they start 
	school to when they leave high school. They can participate in four different types of competitions: JRFLL, FLL, FTC, FRC.
	Each are different competitions based on grade level for the students. They can start out with legos in elementary school 
	to full blown robots in high school. This was a program that came to my school when I was a second year. I got to join FRC 
	and build robots to compete in games designed by FIRST. This program helped me build my leadership skills which I didn't 
	know that I had before. Without this program, I probably wouldn't be at Michigan Tech and I'm really happy I got to experience FRC. 
	If you would like to check out FRC you can go to their site by clicking <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc"><strong> here</strong> </a>.
	You can also check out my home town's team by clicking
	<a href="http://local.boyne.k12.mi.us/robotics/default.aspx"> <strong>here</strong> </a> 
	and seeing how they are doing in this years competition.
