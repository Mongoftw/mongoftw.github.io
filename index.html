                            <p>MyEDU4MTU was a project that myself and 3 others tried to make in our Team Software Project Class. This project was to try and replace MyEDU which was an online class scheduler that helped college students plan their semesters visually. In the end, we were way over our head and failed in making a fully working project. We may have failed, but failure is the best teacher because I learned a lot from this project.</p>
