	<p> 
	So I guess I should say that my name is not really Biscuit.
	"That's not my name,(bum bum) that's not may name". I had to do that, sorry. In case you didn't get it, 
	that is from the song, That's Not my Name by the Ting Tings. You can click 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1c2OfAzDTI"><strong>here</strong></a> for the song.
	My actual name is Richard Carpenter Jr. I am a Software Engineer at 
	<a href="http://www.mtu.edu/"><strong>Michigan Technological University</strong></a>.
	To learn more about me, you will have to either contact me or go <a href="WhoAmI.html"> <strong>here</strong></a>.
